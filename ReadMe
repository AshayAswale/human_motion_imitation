Installation source:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ROS/comments/6qejy0/openni_kinect_installation_on_kinetic_indigo/

NITE from 
https://github.com/arnaud-ramey/NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-v1.5.2.23

If no device found or something like that while launching openni_launch, try 
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch device_id:=#2

But this will impact other packages. 

So uninstall the install.sh using 
./install.sh -u 


Install the NITE in x64, even if the computer specs are x86

If kinect stops publishing the data on rostopics, stop the roslaunch, disconnect and connect again the kinect.
